I can't remember when
I felt like I could fall
It could've been yesterday
Or maybe not at all
I'm trying to find my way to you
Cause I've got you in my head
There are not enough words I could say to you
She looked at me and said
"I know the distances are far between us
Can't let this go cause I'm always gonna be a dreamer"
As star-crossed as it seems
I still choose to believe
It's a small world, yeah
I try to crystallize my fictive thoughts
You may not realize, but that's what I'm here for
Yeah, it's getting kinda dark now all the time
I think you see it, too
All the sketches of our fate just don't align
I'll wait to see it, too
"I know the distances are far between us
Can't let this go cause I'm always gonna be a dreamer"
As star-crossed as it seems
I still choose to believe
It's a small world
No I won't change my mind
This time
I really wanna make you mine
It's hard to ever know
if I should let it go
"I know the distances are far between us
Can't let this go cause I'm always gonna be a dreamer"
As star-crossed as it seems
I still choose to believe
It's a small world
But I won't change my mind
No I won't change my mind this time
I won't change my mind
No I won't change my mind this time
